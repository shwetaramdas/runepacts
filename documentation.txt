Welcome to the runepacts wiki!

RunEpacts is designed to prepare and/or submit datasets to EPACTS for rare variant association, and to present EPACTS output from said tests in a format that's easy to interpret visually (output described in a later section). 

RunEpacts consists of 2 scripts:a Python script and an R script (which is called by the python script). Runepacts can also be used to submit the same set of input files to EPACTS for multiple runs with multiple parameters without separate formatting for each run (for example, the same set of input files can be submitted with specifications for different masks/different sets of covariates).
RunEpacts generates a PDF file containing QQ plots and Manhattan plots for the groupwise tests, for the groupwise tests with filtered groups (using only those genes that fit criteria of minimum numbers of variants/minor allele counts), and single-marker results for those significant genes (those genes that meet the p-value cutoff--default is 0.05)

Running Runepacts:
Input files:
1. Compulsory files:
-Config file: Specifies parameters and directories
-VCF file: Can be annotated/unannotated
-PED file: Sample information files

2. Optional files:
-Annotation file: Allows users to create non-standard groups of variants
-Groupfile: Pre-created group file in the EPACTS format, if this exists
-Gene list file: File that restricts analysis to a list of genes/groups

File formats:
Config file: There are two columns per line, the first being the parameter name and the second the parameter value. When all parameters have been input, the line 'PROCESS' (with only one column, and no parameter value in the 2nd column) submits a job to the script, which in turn process the paramters and input files into an epacts run.
Every instance of 'PROCESS' must have a unique instance of 'OUTPREFIX'
The following are the parameters that can be used in the config file: 
Directories:
INPUTDIR    Directory where input files are found. Can be local path from the folder containing the python script, or global path [COMPULSORY]
EPACTSDIR   Directory from which epacts should be run. If not set, the script assumes epacts is in the path. [OPTIONAL]
OUTPREFIX   Directory where results and output files are written. [COMPULSORY]

Files:
VCFFILE     Vcf file name. Should be present in the INPUTDIR. If option SEPCHR is on, this refers to the chr1 VCF [COMPULSORY]
PEDFILE     Tab-delimited file containing sample information. Header compulsory. The first five columns have to be Fam_ID,IND_ID,FAT_ID,MOT_ID,SEX respectively (the can be named differently but must contain this information). [COMPULSORY]
ANNOTFILE   Variant-wise annotation file. [OPTIONAL]
ANNOTVARCOL The column in ANNOTFILE containing the variant name (The first column is 1, and not 0.). Default = 1[OPTIONAL]
ANNOTGENECOL  The column in ANNOTFILE containing the gene name (The first column is 1, and not 0.) Default = 5[OPTIONAL]
ANNOTPOSCOL The column in ANNOTFILE containing the variant position (The first column is 1, and not 0.) Position is formatted as chr:position (example: 10:11001248). Default = 2[OPTIONAL]
GROUPFILE   [OPTIONAL]
KINSHIPFILE Sample Kinship file used for EMMAX. If not provided, the script will use EPACTS to generate a kinship file. [OPTIONAL]
MAFFILE     File containing MAF information. Provinding this is not recommended, since setting a sample filter will change the MAF values for each variant for the sample subset being analysed. If not provided, MAF calculations and any maf-based filtering are performed by the script. [OPTIONAL]
Tests to run:
MODEL       The phenotype with (if any) covariates to be used. The format is: Phenotype ~ Covariate1+ Covariate2. The ped file should have a column for the phenotype and each of the covariates. [COMPULSORY]
TEST        Which test to run. Example: group=skat [COMPULSORY]

Filtering parameters:
FILTERPED   An expression that allows you to filter samples using one of the columns in the PEDFILE [OPTIONAL]
FILTERMAF   This can either be used as a MAF filter (example 0.05), or an expression that allows filtering of the MAF file (example:  'COLUMN1 < 0.001')[OPTIONAL]
FILTERANNOT [OPTIONAL]
MINVARS     Specify the minimum number of variants a gene must have for it to be included in the output [OPTIONAL]
GENEMINMAC  Specify the minimum number of minor alleles a gene must have [OPTIONAL]
PVALUETHRESHOLD What p-value cut-off from the group-wise test should be used to classify a gene as significant? Default = 0.05 [OPTIONAL]
