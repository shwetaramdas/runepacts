Welcome to the runepacts wiki!

RunEpacts is designed to prepare and/or submit datasets for rare variant association, and to present results from said tests in a format that's easy to interpret visually. 
RunEpacts consists of 2 scripts --a Python script and an R script. 

Running Runepacts:
Input files:
1. Compulsory files:
-Config file: Specifies parameters and directories
-VCF file: Can be annotated/unannotated
-PED file: Sample information files

2. Optional files:
-Annotation file: Allows users to create non-standard groups of variants
-Groupfile
-Gene list file: File that restricts analysis to a list of genes/groups

File formats:
Config file: There are two columns per line, the first being the parameter name and the second the parameter value. The following are the parameters accepted:
Directories:
INPUTDIR    Directory where input files are found. Can be local path from the folder containing the python script, or global path [COMPULSORY]
EPACTSDIR   Directory from which epacts should be run. If not set, the script assumes epacts is in the path. [OPTIONAL]
Files:
VCFFILE     Vcf file name. Should be present in the INPUTDIR [COMPULSORY]
PEDFILE     File containing sample information. Header compulsory. The first five columns have to be Fam_ID,IND_ID,FAT_ID,MOT_ID,SEX respectively. [COMPULSORY]
ANNOTFILE   [OPTIONAL]
GROUPFILE   [OPTIONAL]
KINSHIPFILE Sample Kinship file used for EMMAX. If not provided, the script will use EPACTS to generate a kinship file. [OPTIONAL]
MAFFILE     [OPTIONAL]
Tests to run:
MODEL       [COMPULSORY]
TEST        [COMPULSORY]
Filtering parameters:
FILTERPED   [OPTIONAL]
FILTERMAF   [OPTIONAL]
MINVARS     [OPTIONAL]
GENEMINMAC  [OPTIONAL]
PVALUETHRESHOLD What p-value cut-off from the group-wise test should be used to classify a gene as significant? Default = 0.05 [OPTIONAL]
